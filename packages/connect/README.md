# @haven_ai/connect

Connect Agent 2 local connector.

This command runs in the user's agent environment. It generates the agent
signing key and API key locally, stores them locally, and sends Haven only the
public signing address, proof signature, and API-key hash. Haven never receives
the private key or plaintext API key.

```sh
npx -y @haven_ai/connect --setup hv_setup_... --api https://api.haven.example --runtime claude-code
```

The connector writes owner-only credential files outside the project by default:

- `~/.haven/agents/<agent-id>/identity.json` contains the Haven API key.
- `~/.haven/agents/<agent-id>/signer.json` contains the local signer key.

The API key identifies the agent. It cannot spend by itself. Payments still need
the locally held signer key and the user-approved on-chain Haven wallet rules.

Use `--credentials-dir <path>` to choose a different local credential directory.
Do not point it at a project repository, shared folder, or cloud-synced folder.
