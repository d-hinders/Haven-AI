Release headers are written by the release bump (`npm run release:bump`), never by
hand — true since the changelog-heading gap, and stated here only because it was asserted for a long
time while being false. The bump rewrites the `## Unreleased` heading below into
`## <version> — <date>`; add entries under `## Unreleased` and leave the heading
alone.

## Unreleased

## 0.2.0-alpha.0 — 2026-09-14

### Naming epic #2906, phase 1 (#2908) — reads both names, prefers the new

| Reader | Chain (earlier wins) | Window |
|---|---|---|
| credential file, single and split (`loadCredentials`) | `account_address ?? safe_address ?? safeAddress` (per file; split files must agree, mismatch is labelled `account_address`) | the two old keys are read **permanently** |
| environment | `HAVEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS ?? HAVEN_WALLET_ADDRESS ?? HAVEN_SAFE_ADDRESS` | `HAVEN_WALLET_ADDRESS` / `HAVEN_SAFE_ADDRESS` removed at #2914 |

`HavenCredentialFile` gains an explicit `accountAddress` key (this shape is
separate from the signer's); `safeAddress` is kept with the same value and
`@deprecated` — **removed in the release after the one carrying #2908
(#2914)**. Exported: `readAccountAddressField()`, `readAccountAddressEnv()`.
The consent seed prefers the SDK's `accountAddress` and falls back to
`safeAddress`; the consent hash input value is unchanged either way.
