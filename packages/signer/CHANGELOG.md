Release headers are written by the release bump (`npm run release:bump`), never by
hand — true since the changelog-heading gap, and stated here only because it was asserted for a long
time while being false. The bump rewrites the `## Unreleased` heading below into
`## <version> — <date>`; add entries under `## Unreleased` and leave the heading
alone.

## Unreleased

## 0.2.1-alpha.0 — 2026-09-16

### Added

- Sign-context refusals carry `code`, `fallback` and `next_action`, matching the shape
  the version-mismatch refusal already used (#3001). Additive: no refusal was removed
  and no field became required.

### Fixed

- `fetchX402SignContext` aborts after 15 seconds instead of hanging the agent
  indefinitely (#2985). A timeout is a refusal to proceed, never a decision to sign.

## 0.2.0-alpha.0 — 2026-09-14

### Naming epic #2906, phase 1 (#2908) — reads both names, prefers the new

| Reader | Chain (earlier wins) | Window |
|---|---|---|
| credential file (`loadSignerCredentials`) | `account_address ?? safe_address ?? safeAddress` | the two old keys are read **permanently** (a file on disk never rewrites itself) |
| environment | `HAVEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS ?? HAVEN_WALLET_ADDRESS ?? HAVEN_SAFE_ADDRESS` | `HAVEN_WALLET_ADDRESS` / `HAVEN_SAFE_ADDRESS` removed at #2914 |

`SignerCredentials` gains `accountAddress`; `safeAddress` is kept with the
same value and `@deprecated` — **removed in the release after the one
carrying #2908 (#2914)**. Exported: `readAccountAddressField()`,
`readAccountAddressEnv()`.

**No expected-context version change:** `SUPPORTED_X402_EXPECTED_VERSIONS`
stays `[1, 2, 3]` (asserted by `naming-window-no-version-change.test.ts`);
`sign_data.components.*` is response metadata, never part of the signed
payload. `capabilities.ts` and `core.ts` are unchanged except comments.
